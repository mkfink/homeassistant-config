# IR codes correspond to an Insignia TV (manufactured ~2011)
# Codes came from this post http://www.remotecentral.com/cgi-bin/forums/viewpost.cgi?1167735
# and then were converted from hex to raw coes with IrScrutinizer https://github.com/bengtmartensson/IrScrutinizer/releases
# following instructions from https://github.com/Arduino-IRremote/Arduino-IRremote/issues/263#issuecomment-195486942
