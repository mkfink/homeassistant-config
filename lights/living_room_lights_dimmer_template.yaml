# This template light entity fixes an issue with the ESPHome dimmer.
# ESPHome is configured with min/max dimmer values of 15%/100%.
# The Home Assistant UI correspondingly gives you a dimmer that can't
# be set blelow 15%. If you select < 15%, the slider jumps back up to 15%.
# Usable, but not ideal. Since Home Assistant uses 0-255 for brightness, 
# we need to map {38.25:255} to {0:255} when sending brightness commands to
# the light. And then we need to map in the other direction when reading the
# brightness reported by the light. Except a brightness of 0, to Home
# Assistant, means Off (which it doesn't know how to interpret when it also
# sees that the light is On), so the if/else in level_template fixes this.
#
# See '../esphome/Living Room Lights.yaml' for the ESPHome config
